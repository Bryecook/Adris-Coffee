# Welcome to Adri's Coffee

## You can use this app to order coffee from any of our 4 locations in Austin/Houston! If you're a new user, you can sign up and create an account with a username or password, and don't worry if you forget your password, we have password recovery options! After signing in, you can select the store you would like to order from, and check your account balance/add money into your account. You can select from our drink menu and decide how you would like to pay for your coffee. If you have accumulated enough reward points, then you can purchase your orders with points or you can purchase using your account balance. After placing your order, you will be given a receipt number for you to provide to the store and will be asked if you'd like to provide a tip. If you made any mistakes along the way, feel free to use our cancel order option. Enjoy your coffee!
